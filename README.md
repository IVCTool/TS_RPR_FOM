# Experimental RPR_FOM Test Suite

This repository will be used for the development of the RPR FOM Test Suite. Currently it is only a draft and contains only initial design artefact.

## Interoperability Requirements

The test suite is designed to test the [Interoperability Requirements](docs/src/interoperability-requirements.md) defined RPR FOM modules.


## IVCT Compliance

The current test suite design uses the ServiceLoader interface feature of the IVCT framework. This is only available in the latest snapshot releases and not yet included in the production release.
